For real x in the interval [-1, 1] and integer n > 1 with P<sub>n</sub>(x) = 1 for n = 0 and P<sub>n</sub>(x) = x for n = 1
## Description
This project accomplishes the following (in order):
* Print values of P<sub>n</sub>(x) for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5, in intervals of âˆ†x = 0.5
* Graph these functions
