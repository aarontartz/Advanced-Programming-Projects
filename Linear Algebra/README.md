## Description
This project accomplishes the following (in order):
* Apply the upper triangular algorithm to matrix A and implement partial row pivoting in the upper triangular algorithm, so that it searches all rows below the current row i in the row iteration to find the row j, such that if rows i and j were swapped, the swapped in row would have the largest diagonal element in absolute value.
* Apply LU decompsition algorithm with same partial row pivoting, and save indices of the rows that are pivoted into a data structure.
* Use factors L and U to solve Ax = b for x
